  "description": "Vachellia nilotica (formerly Acacia nilotica), commonly known as Babul, is a tree in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. It is a thorny tree that grows up to 14 meters high with a dense, spherical crown. The bark is dark brown to black, deeply fissured. The leaves are bipinnate, with 3-6 pairs of pinnae, each with 10-30 pairs of leaflets. The flowers are bright golden-yellow, spherical heads, fragrant, and appear in clusters. The fruit is a flattened, hairy, indehiscent pod, constricted between the seeds. The tree is well-adapted to arid and semi-arid regions and is known for its drought resistance. It plays a significant role in traditional medicine and is also used for timber, fodder, and gum arabic production.",
