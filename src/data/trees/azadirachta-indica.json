  "description": "Azadirachta indica, commonly known as Neem, Nimtree, or Indian Lilac, is a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is one of two species in the genus Azadirachta, and is native to the Indian subcontinent. It is typically grown in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem trees are noted for their drought resistance. Normally it thrives in areas with sub-arid to sub-humid conditions, with an annual rainfall of 400–1,200 mm. It can grow in many different types of soil, but thrives best on well-drained deep and sandy soils. It is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of 15–20 metres (49–66 ft), rarely 35–40 metres (115–131 ft).",
